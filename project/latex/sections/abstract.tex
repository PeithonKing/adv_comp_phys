    The problem we address in this work is substructure-finding in dark matter halos from gravity-only N-body simulations, which is typically solved using percolation algorithms that require simulation history and increase the simulation cost. To overcome these limitations, we apply point-cloud segmentation techniques using Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods.
    
    Specifically, given a halo represented as a point cloud, our goal is to classify each point into either belonging to a halo or the background, and if it belongs to a halo, differentiate which halo it is a part of. To address the challenges of large datasets and significant class imbalance between the background and sub-halo classes, we implement techniques for efficient processing of large datasets and methods to balance the class distribution.
    
    Our approach uses point cloud data to train a neural network that can classify points in these simulations without requiring simulation history. This results in accurate and efficient substructure identification.
